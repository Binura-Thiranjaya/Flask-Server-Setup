# Flask Server Setup

## Instructions

1. **Create Server File:**
    - Create a new file named `server.py` using the following command:
        ```bash
        touch server.py
        ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment:**
    - Set up a virtual environment by running the following command:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```

3. **Activate Virtual Environment:**
    - Activate the virtual environment using the following command:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Install the required dependencies by executing the following commands:
        ```bash
        pip3 install flask
        pip3 install space
        ```

5. **Run the Server:**
    - Run the Flask server using the following command:
        ```bash
        python3 server.py
        ```

Your Flask server should now be up and running. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

### Additional Notes

- Make sure to keep the virtual environment activated while running the server.
- Feel free to customize the `server.py` file to suit your application needs.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the Flask and Space documentation for troubleshooting.

Enjoy building your Flask application!
